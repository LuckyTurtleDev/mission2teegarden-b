Programmers, we will have to take a small break from our usual missions. We have received a very strange signal not too far from your last mission.
The robots have already been dispatched. Please check it out immediately. Any further sample collection will be put on hold for now.

Here is the map of our current place. Any closer to the weird signal wasn't possible, as we don't know what landing closer to it could lead to.
Be careful. Those violet patches seem rather ominous, but besides the different color, they don't seem to be much different from normal grass.
The path to the weird signal source seems to be somewhat complicated, but I am sure you will manage.

[[after_level]]

We have gotten closer to the source already. Our computers don't really seem to like that. Hmmâ€¦ as it seems though, we don't really face any difficulties yet.
