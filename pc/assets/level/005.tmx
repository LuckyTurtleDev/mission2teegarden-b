Hello back, programmers. Your captain is speaking.
I have just received good news from our engineers. 
The commands have been successfully recovered. They should work fine now.
Let's go back to our last mission to try out your new cards.

Here we are again. 
Anyway, this time around, it should be a lot easier for you to reach your goal without crashing.
In your programming panel, you'll now have the commands to turn your robot's motor off and back on.
Of course, the robots themselves will still be on during said period.
Therefore they will still be able to follow your commands.
Turning the motor off simply means that the robot won't move anymore until the motor is turned on again. 
It's very useful, isn't it?
Well, then, this should be easy to do now. 
There is certainly no problem for you.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

How do you like your new commands? Certainly useful, no?
Anyway, let's actually do some proper missions now!
