[![Packaging status][__link1]][__link2]

Prebuild binaries can also be downloaded from the [GitHub release][__link3].


#### Building from source:

Alternative you can easily build Mission to Teegarden b  by yourself:

 - On Linux, install the following development dependencies. On some distros (like Alpine and Debian), separate development packages exist, regular suffixed with `-dev`. If this is the case, make sure that you have also installed the `*-dev` version.
	 - [`alsa-lib`][__link4]
	 - [`libudev`][__link5]
	
	
 - [Install rust][__link6]
 - [Download][__link7] and unpack the source code.
 - Run `cargo install --path pc --locked` inside the unpacked folder, to build and install mission2teegarden-b. See the [rust book][__link8] for more information about cargo install.
 - Make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is listed in the `PATH` environment variable otherwise, the `mission2teegarden-b` executable can not be found.


## Flash Pybadge:

 - Install an UF2 flasher. I recommend using [hf2-cli][__link9].
 - Download and unpack Pybadge binary from [GitHub release][__link10].
 - Press the reset button of the pybdage twice, to enter the bootloader.
 - After this, execute `hf2 elf mission2teegarden-b-pybadge` (or the corresponding command of your flashing tool) to flash the binary to the pybadge.
 - Press the reset button again.


#### Building from source:

Alternative you can build m3 by yourself:

 - [Install rustup][__link11]
 - Run `cargo install hf2-cli --locked` to build and install the [hf2-cli][__link12] flasher. See the [rust book][__link13] for more information about cargo install.
 - Make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is listed at the `PATH` environment variable, otherwise the executeable can not be found..
 - Install the rust `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target (the architecture of the pybadge) by executing `rustup target install thumbv7em-none-eabihf`.
 - Optional: install nightly toolchain for better error messages at the pybadge. `rustup toolchain install nightly --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
 - [Download][__link14] and unpack the source code (if not already done).
 - Press the reset button of the pybadge twice to enter bootloader
 - Compile and flash program by running `cargo +nightly run --release -locked` inside the downloaded `pybadge` folder. `+nightly` is optional and have to be left out if the ‚Äúinstall nightly toolchain‚Äù step was skip. Please use `+nightly` for bug reports.
 - Press the reset button again.


## Map/Level Editor:

Mission to Teegarden b allow creating custom maps/levels, by using the powerfull [Tiled Map editor][__link15]. See [here][__link16] for more information about creating maps.
