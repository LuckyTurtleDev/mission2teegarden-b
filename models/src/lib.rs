//! This create store models and protcoll data,
//! which is used by the communication between pybadeg and pc.
//!
//! # Protocol:
//! Every message is neither a Protocoll message or a Gamevent.
//! The [`KeepAlive`](`MessageToPc::KeepAlive) is also definded at toplevel, to make it only one byte big,
//! because it is send very frequently to pc.
//! The pc assume that the [`KeepAlive`](`MessageToPc::KeepAlive) message is send at least once every second.
//! Otherwise the pc assume that the pypbadge was disconnected.
//!
//! ### Connection Establishment
//! The pc search for seriell devices at start and does send an [`ConnectionRequest`](ToPybadgeProtocol::ConnectionRequest)
//! to each Seriell devices.
//! The pybadge responds with [`ConnectionResponse`](ToPcProtocol::ConnectionResponse).
//! After sending an [`ConnectionResponse`](ToPcProtocol::ConnectionResponse)
//! the pybadge start listen to other incomming message too.
